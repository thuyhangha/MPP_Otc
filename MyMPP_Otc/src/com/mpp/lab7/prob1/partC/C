The error happens because the code used HashMap to check for duplicated.

When it passed employee object to HashMap, it will call the hashCode() method which was not override. It leads to the
default hashCode() in Object class is called. And 2 identical employee has 2 different hash code regardless they had
the same "name" and "salary"

Solution: override hashCode() method
